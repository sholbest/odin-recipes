    <p>This oven-fried chicken is so much easier and less messy than traditional fried chicken! Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.</p></div>
    <div class="chicken ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> This recipe calls for 12 chicken thighs, but you could also use breasts, legs, wings, or drumsticks.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour adds crispness, seals in moisture, and encourages browning.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Bread Crumbs:</strong> You can use store-bought Italian-seasoned bread crumbs or make your own at home.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Whole eggs add moisture and give the flour and bread crumbs something to stick to.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This oven-fried chicken is simply seasoned with salt and pepper, plus a little paprika for subtle heat and smoky flavor.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Vegetable oil keeps the chicken moist and juicy. Canola oil or olive oil would also work well for this recipe.</li><br>     
    </ul></div>
    <div class="chicken steps"><h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li> Dredge the chicken thighs by coating them in the flour (seasoned with salt and pepper), the eggs, and then the bread crumbs.</li><br> 
       <li> Pour the oil into a baking dish, then add the coated chicken thighs.</li><br>
       <li> Sprinkle with paprika and bake in a preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li><br>
